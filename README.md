## About

I created this project a few years ago after happening upon the idea of procedural maze generation somewhere on the internet, and deciding to create a maze generator for myself. I used a version of depth first search to do this, which of course is more commonly used to solve mazes, but I felt (and indeed still feel) that generating mazes automatically is more appealing than solving them automatically. Creating mazes by hand is quite tedious and boring, while solving them by hand can be very enjoyable. Thus, it makes more sense to automate the boring task and leave the interesting and enjoyable task to the human.

In the end, it wound up being a pretty simple project, but certainly a worthwhile exercise in understanding this algorithm and its application to the task of procedural maze generation.

## Usage

To use, ensure that pygame is installed, then run maze.py on the command line. The program will prompt the user for the dimensions of the maze, before creating a new window to display it. To save an image of a maze, press 's' while inside the window and the image will be saved to the 'mazes' folder.
