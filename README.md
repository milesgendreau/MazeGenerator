## About

I created this project a few years ago after happening upon the idea of procedural maze generation somewhere on the internet, and deciding to create a maze generator for myself.
I used a version of depth first search to do this, which of course is more commonly used to solve mazes, but I felt (and indeed still feel) that generating mazes automatically is more
appealing than solving them automatically. Creating mazes by hand is quite tedious and boring, while solving them by hand can be very enjoyable. Thus, it makes more sense
to automate the boring task and leave the interesting and enjoyable task to the human.

In the end, it wound up being a pretty simple project, but certainly a worthwhile exercise in understanding this algorithm and its application to the task of procedural maze generation.
